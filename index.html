    <p class="history-text">Breathwork, the practice of controlling
      breath to enhance physical, mental, and spiritual well-being,
      has roots in ancient traditions. It dates back thousands of years,
      with origins in yoga (India) and pranayama (breath control techniques).
      In China, Taoist practices incorporated breathwork for energy flow and longevity.
      Similarly, Buddhist meditation emphasized mindful breathing for focus and clarity.</p>

      <p>It’s like before I couldn’t move but now I want to move … both physically and also in life, like things can
        move and change and it could feel good rather than scary or pointless … I don’t know if that makes sense but
        it’s the only way I can think to explain it at the moment. <br><br> – Jen</p>

      <p>It feels like I can feel again, like I’ve been numb and now I can feel stuff again. I feel excited about all
        sorts of things, projects that I have thought of for a while but felt daunting or even though I wanted to do
        them I didn’t have the drive but now I feel like they will be fun. <br><br> - Mike</p>

      <p>Since the breath session and workshop last week I feel like a different person! I think it took a day or so
        after the workshop to really take root but I’m kind of blown away with the effect it has had on me.<br><br> -

      <p>I was apprehensive about the session initially and was a little worried how I would react. I had a very
        physical reaction to the session which surprised me. I felt reflective post session, but more at peace and this
        may sound odd but I felt lighter. <br><br> - Sarrah</p>
